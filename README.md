**Brain Tumor Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks**
In this project, I harnessed state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to elevate diagnostic accuracy. The focus was on leveraging the power of neural networks to enhance the performance of the model.

To ensure optimal model generalization, I meticulously preprocessed and applied data augmentation techniques to a dataset comprising brain MRI scans. This step aimed at expanding the diversity of the dataset and improving the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

The development and fine-tuning of the CNN model were carried out using Python and popular libraries like TensorFlow and Keras. These tools provided a robust and flexible environment for building and optimizing deep learning models.

In addition, I conducted a comparative analysis with pre-trained models, employing transfer learning techniques to assess their effectiveness. This comparison aimed to evaluate the performance of the developed model against established benchmarks, providing valuable insights into the model's capabilities in relation to existing state-of-the-art solutions.
